Data Speculations has been in development since 2023, and work has been ongoing for over a year to organize the National Forum. The Project Team is presenting at various academic conferences in the field to raise awareness and solicit feedback. 

In 2025, the National Forum will take place, with a week-long series of events with practitioners in the field. Additional convenings with relevant stakeholders will take place over the year at Temple University Libraries and other venues.
