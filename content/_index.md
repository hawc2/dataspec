# Overviewing the Forum

Data Speculations is a National Forum sponsored by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This National Forum will bring together specialists in the fields of law, libraries, and literature to explore the future of curating copyrighted cultural collections as data.

Data Speculations: A National Forum seeks to advance the development of infrastructure, policies, expertise, and collections that enable computational research on copyrighted contemporary culture materials. The forum, to be held in January 2025, is led by a team of digital humanities and copyright experts, Alex Wermer-Colan, Sarah Potvin, Peter Jaszi, Brandon Butler, and Rachael Samberg, and will bring together specialists in digital humanities research, collections, and library data services. By convening a dedicated community of practice at a National Forum, hosting public talks, and producing findings and guidelines for wider dissemination, Data Speculations will be foundational to the collective work of removing access barriers for sharing copyrighted collections, serving librariesâ€™ core mission to make information, including copyrighted data, available to researchers and teachers to advance teaching and scholarship.
 
At a time when multinational publishing houses and database vendors increasingly speculate (quite literally) on the landscape of digitized contemporary culture, charging libraries for licensed access to their collections of newspapers and magazines as data, Data Speculations seeks an alternative vision: a future where libraries can steward large collections of copyrighted cultural data. This National Forum will convene a diverse field of specialists, with the goal of producing recommendations for a wider range of use cases and contexts, empowering diverse communities to take ownership of their research data and, on their own terms, open it up to new modes of digital analysis and curation. By analyzing needs, developing a proof of concept legal framework, and convening relevant stakeholders and experts, Data Speculations will inform the next-stage development and implementation of partnerships, protocols, tools, and best practice guidance to unlock collection access.
