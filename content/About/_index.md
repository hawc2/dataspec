The Institute of Museum and Library Services-sponsored National Forum, *Data Speculations*, seeks to advance the development of infrastructure, policies, expertise, and collections that enable computational research on copyrighted contemporary culture materials.

*Data Speculations: A National Forum on Library Digital Stewardship for Copyrighted Contemporary Culture* is led by a team of digital humanities and copyright experts, Alex Wermer-Colan, Sarah Potvin, Peter Jaszi, Brandon Butler, and Rachael Samberg. The convenings brings together specialists in digital humanities research, collections, and library data services. Convenings for the National Forum will include both closed virtual convenings, public conference presentations, and related programming, reports, and publications.

By gathering a dedicated community of practice at a National Forum, hosting public talks, and producing findings and guidelines for wider dissemination, *Data Speculations* will be foundational to the collective work of removing access barriers for sharing copyrighted collections, serving libraries’ core mission to make information, including copyrighted data, available to researchers and teachers to advance teaching and scholarship. At a time when multinational publishing houses and database vendors increasingly speculate on the landscape of digitized contemporary culture, charging libraries for licensed access to their collections of newspapers and magazines as data, *Data Speculations* seeks an alternative vision: a future where libraries can steward large collections of copyrighted cultural data.

# Data Speculations Program Schedule
*Data Speculations: A National Forum* will bring together a wide range of scholars and practitioners to discuss the future of computational access to copyrighted data and explore a series of case studies, including the [SF Nexus project](https://sfnexus.io/).

The National Forum's opening convening will take place in January of 2025, and the project will feature a series of additional events over the 2025 year.

# SF Nexus
The SF Nexus comprises a collaborative network of research and public libraries with collections of SF. The SF Nexus aspires to make a comprehensive dataset of science fiction literature. 

For more information about the SF Nexus project, visit [sfnexus.io](https://sfnexus.io/). To learn more about SF Nexus' approach to data curation of literary texts, see Alex Wermer-Colan's and James Kopaczewski's article, ["The New Wave of Digital Collections: Speculating on the Future of Library Curation"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45420508#metadata_info_tab_contents)(2022)

## Paskow Science Fiction Collection, Temple University Special Collections Research Center
The [Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio](https://library.temple.edu/lcdss)  partnered with [Temple University Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)](https://library.temple.edu/scrc) and [Digital Library Initiatives (DLI)](https://digital.library.temple.edu/) to build a digitized corpus of copyrighted science fiction literature. Besides its voluminous [Urban Archives](https://library.temple.edu/collections/urban-archives), the SCRC also houses a significant collection of science-fiction literature. The [Paskow Science Fiction Collection](https://library.temple.edu/collections/paskow-science-fiction-collection-science-fiction-and-fantasy) was originally established in 1972, when Temple acquired 5,000 science fiction paperbacks from a Temple alumnus, the late David C. Paskow. 

For an exhibit of SF book covers from the Paskow collection, visit our companion [Omeka site]( https://lcdssgeo.com/omeka-s/s/scifi/page/digitizing-science-fiction).

# Science Fiction Collection Libraries Consortium (SFCLC)
[Website for Science Fiction Collection Libraries Consortium](http://sfspecialcollections.pbworks.com/w/page/75814541/About%20the%20SciFi%20Collection%20Libraries%20Consortium%20%28SFCLC%29)
The SFCLC comprises a series of special collections across North America and England focusing on preserving and expanding access to the history of science fiction publishing. The SF Nexus aspires to leverage the SFCLC's holdings to create larger science fiction datasets that can be shared through member-supported repositories like HathiTrust Digital Library and through digital scholarship centers at these universities.
