# SF Nexus
The SF Nexus comprises a collaborative network of research and public libraries with collections of SF. The SF Nexus aspires to make a comprehensive dataset of science fiction literature.

For an overview of the SF Nexus' approach to data curation of literary texts, see Alex Wermer-Colan's and James Kopaczewski's article, ["The New Wave of Digital Collections: Speculating on the Future of Library Curation"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45420508#metadata_info_tab_contents)(2022)

## Paskow Science Fiction Collection, Temple University Special Collections Research Center
The [Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio](https://library.temple.edu/lcdss) has partnered with [Temple University Librariesâ€™ Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)](https://library.temple.edu/scrc) and [Digital Library Initiatives (DLI)](https://digital.library.temple.edu/) to build a digitized corpus of copyrighted science fiction literature. Besides its voluminous [Urban Archives](https://library.temple.edu/collections/urban-archives), the SCRC also houses a significant collection of science-fiction literature. The [Paskow Science Fiction Collection](https://library.temple.edu/collections/paskow-science-fiction-collection-science-fiction-and-fantasy) was originally established in 1972, when Temple acquired 5,000 science fiction paperbacks from a Temple alumnus, the late David C. Paskow.
